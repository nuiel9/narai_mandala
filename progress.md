# Progress — Narai Mandala

## Current Status (2025-10-19)

### ✅ Completed Systems
- **Core Game Loop**: 8-turn seasonal progression with Thai season names
- **Turn Manager**: Functional turn advancement with Enter/Space input
- **Game State**: Prestige (0-999), Stability (-100 to 100), Silver tracking with automatic +5 per turn
- **Market System**: Dynamic pricing with drift mechanics for 6 commodities
- **Event System**: JSON-driven random events with effects on stats and market
- **Diplomacy Framework**: Faction relationship tracking (Dutch, French, Persian)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Automated test runner for system validation
- **Project Structure**: Clean autoload singleton architecture with signal-based communication
- **TileMap System**: 40x20 procedural map with land/river/city tiles and runtime TileSet generation
- **Trade Panel v2**: Complete trading interface with inventory tracking, transaction log, and buy/sell controls
- **Save/Load System**: ConfigFile-based game state persistence with keyboard shortcuts

### 🏗️ Implementation Details
- **Files**: 12+ GDScript files across systems, UI, world, and tests
- **Architecture**: Signal-driven design with 6 autoloaded singletons (including SaveLoad)
- **Data**: JSON configuration for events, factions, and goods
- **UI**: TopBar + enhanced TradePanel with real-time inventory and transaction logging
- **World**: TileMap-based procedural world generation with 3 tile types
- **Input**: Multiple keyboard shortcuts (T=Trade, Ctrl+S=Save, Ctrl+L=Load, N=Next Turn)

### 🎮 Current Gameplay
1. Game starts with initial stats (Prestige: 0, Stability: 50, Silver: 100) and procedural world map
2. Interactive trading system:
   - Press T to open Trade Panel
   - Buy/sell goods in quantities of 1, 5, or 10
   - Track inventory and total value in real-time
   - View transaction history (last 10 trades)
   - First trade per goods type grants +1 Prestige
3. Each turn:
   - Market prices drift ±10% with visual flash indicators
   - Random event may trigger with stat/market effects
   - Player gains +5 silver automatically
   - Press Enter/Space/N to advance
4. Save/Load functionality:
   - Ctrl+S to save game state
   - Ctrl+L to load previous save
   - All systems synchronized on load
5. Game ends after 8 turns with "Game Over" message

### 🎯 MVP Status
- ✅ Turn system (8 turns, seasonal rotation)
- ✅ Market system (6 goods with price drift)
- ✅ Event system (JSON-driven with effects)
- ✅ Basic diplomacy framework
- ✅ Core game state management
- ✅ Web export capability
- ✅ Trade mechanics (complete trading UI with inventory system)
- ✅ Player interaction (trading, save/load, keyboard shortcuts)
- ✅ World representation (TileMap with procedural generation)
- ✅ Save/Load system (ConfigFile-based persistence)
- ⚠️ Win/lose conditions (framework exists, needs implementation)
- ⚠️ Combat system (referenced in tests but not implemented)
- ⚠️ Diplomacy interactions (framework exists, UI needed)

### 📊 Technical Metrics
- **Codebase Size**: 12+ GDScript files across systems, UI, and world
- **Test Coverage**: Basic system validation
- **Performance**: Lightweight, web-export ready
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with 6 autoloaded singletons
- **Save System**: ConfigFile-based with full state persistence
- **Map Generation**: Runtime TileSet creation with procedural world

### 🎨 Assets & Polish
- ✅ Enhanced UI (TopBar + comprehensive Trade Panel)
- ✅ Procedural visual world (TileMap with colored tiles)
- ✅ Real-time feedback (price flash indicators, transaction log)
- ✅ Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Thai localization for season names and cultural authenticity
- ⚠️ No sprite assets (using colored tiles and basic UI)

### 🚀 Next Priorities
1. **Win/Lose Logic**: Implement prestige/stability thresholds and game over conditions
2. **Diplomacy UI**: Add interface for treaty negotiations and faction interactions
3. **Combat System**: Implement referenced combat mechanics from tests
4. **Event Expansion**: Add more diverse events with varied effects
5. **Visual Polish**: Add sprite assets to replace colored tiles
6. **Advanced Trading**: Add market speculation, commodity chains, or trade routes
