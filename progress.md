# Progress — Narai Mandala

## Current Status (2025-10-19)

### ✅ Completed Systems
- **Core Game Loop**: 8-turn seasonal progression with Thai season names
- **Turn Manager**: Functional turn advancement with Enter/Space input
- **Game State**: Prestige (0-999), Stability (-100 to 100), Silver tracking with automatic +5 per turn
- **Market System**: Dynamic pricing with drift mechanics for 6 commodities
- **Event System**: JSON-driven random events with effects on stats and market
- **Diplomacy Framework**: Faction relationship tracking (Dutch, French, Persian)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Automated test runner for system validation
- **Project Structure**: Clean autoload singleton architecture with signal-based communication

### 🏗️ Implementation Details
- **Files**: 8 GDScript files across systems, UI, and tests
- **Architecture**: Signal-driven design with 5 autoloaded singletons
- **Data**: JSON configuration for events, factions, and goods
- **UI**: Basic HUD (TopBar) displaying turn and stats
- **Input**: Simple ui_accept (Enter/Space) for turn progression

### 🎮 Current Gameplay
1. Game starts with initial stats (Prestige: 0, Stability: 50, Silver: 100)
2. Each turn:
   - Market prices drift ±10%
   - Random event may trigger with stat/market effects
   - Player gains +5 silver automatically
   - Press Enter/Space to advance
3. Game ends after 8 turns with "Game Over" message

### 🎯 MVP Status
- ✅ Turn system (8 turns, seasonal rotation)
- ✅ Market system (6 goods with price drift)
- ✅ Event system (JSON-driven with effects)
- ✅ Basic diplomacy framework
- ✅ Core game state management
- ✅ Web export capability
- ⚠️ Win/lose conditions (framework exists, needs implementation)
- ⚠️ Player interaction beyond turn advancement
- ⚠️ Trade mechanics (market exists but no trading UI)
- ⚠️ Combat system (referenced in tests but not implemented)

### 📊 Technical Metrics
- **Codebase Size**: 8 GDScript files
- **Test Coverage**: Basic system validation
- **Performance**: Lightweight, web-export ready
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with autoloaded singletons

### 🎨 Assets & Polish
- ⚠️ Minimal UI (functional TopBar only)
- ⚠️ No visual assets or game art
- ⚠️ Basic 2D scene structure
- ✅ Thai localization for season names and cultural authenticity

### 🚀 Next Priorities
1. **Win/Lose Logic**: Implement prestige/stability thresholds and game over conditions
2. **Trade Interface**: Add UI for buying/selling market goods
3. **Diplomacy Actions**: Implement treaty negotiations and faction interactions  
4. **Visual Polish**: Add basic sprites and UI improvements
5. **Event Expansion**: Add more diverse events with varied effects

### 📝 Development Notes
- Project follows game jam constraints (simple, web-exportable)
- Strong foundation for rapid iteration and feature addition
- Signal-based architecture enables clean UI updates
- JSON data structure supports easy content modification
